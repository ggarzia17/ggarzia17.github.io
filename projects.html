    <h2>Matrix Terminal Screensaver</h2>
    <h3>September 2024</h3>
    <p class="project-p">
        This project was written in C using the <a target="_blank" href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/" class="p-link">ncurses</a> library for the terminal display.
        It features random strings of ASCII characters that fall down the screen and when the -r flag is specified the lines of text will have different colors.
        The specific colors depend on the terminal used as the code uses the color scheme specified by the terminal's theme.

    <h2>Clue</h2>
    <h3>May 2024</h3>
    <p class="project-p">
        This project was created as a group project with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bancell.dev" class="p-link">Brady Ancell</a> for Software Engineering 
        (<a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.mines.edu/search/?P=CSCI306" class="p-link">CSCI306</a>).
        The game logic was built in Java and the GUI was created using the 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html" class="p-link">Java Swing</a> framework.
        The game features all of the major rules of clue. 
        One of the more interesting to implement was moving a player when another player made a suggestion including them, and then updating their valid moves accordingly.
        For example if you end a turn in a room you are not allowed to guess there again unless you were moved there by another player.
        While implementing Clue we utilized Object Oriented Programming concepts such as polymorphism and a singleton pattern.
        In order to ensure quality of code, we implemented tests for all features using the <a target="_blank" href="https://junit.org/junit5/" class="p-link">JUnit</a> framework.
    </p>
    <p class="project-p">
        Mines wants this source code to be private from future CSCI306 students so code is availible upon request.

    <h2>Chess</h2>
    <h3>December 2022</h3>
    <p class="project-p">
        My Chess project was built as a final project for Foundational Programming Concept and Design 
        (<a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.mines.edu/search/?P=CSCI200" class="p-link">CSCI200</a>).
        The user interface built in the terminal and displays each sides captured pieces, the board, a move list, whose turn it is, and a prompt to enter the next move.
        Moves are entered by entering the square of the piece you are moving and then the square it is moving to (Algebraic notation was not added due to time constraints).
        Move validation is implemented and includes rules such as promotion, castling, 2 square first pawn moves, and check/checkmate detection.
        If an invalid move is entered it will tell the user that their move was invalid and prompt them to enter a new move.
