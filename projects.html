    <h3>Clue</h3>
    <h4>May 2024</h4>
    <p class="project-p">
        This project was created as a group project for Software Engineering (CSCI306).
        The game logic was built in Java and the GUI was created using the Java Swing framework.
        The game features all of the major rules of clue. 
        One of the more interesting to implement was moving a player when another player made a suggestion including them, and then updating their valid moves accordingly.
        For example if you end a turn in a room you are not allowed to guess there again unless you were moved there by another player.
        In addition to this we utilized Object Oriented Programming concepts such as polymorphism and a singleton pattern.

    <h3>Chess</h3>
    <h4>December 2022</h4>
    <p class="project-p">
        My Chess project was built as a final project for Foundational Programming Concept and Design (CSCI200).
        The user interface built in the terminal and displays each sides captured pieces, the board, a move list, whose turn it is, and a prompt to enter the next move.
        Moves are entered by entering the square of the piece you are moving and then the square it is moving to (Algebraic notation was not added due to time constraints).
        Move validation is implemented and includes rules such as promotion, castling, 2 square first pawn moves, and check/checkmate detection.
        If an invalid move is entered it will tell the user that their move was invalid and prompt them to enter a new move.
