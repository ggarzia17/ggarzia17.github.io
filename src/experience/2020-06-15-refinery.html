        Started as a dishwasher in June 2020, and was moved up to a cook doing both prep and line work.
        As a prep cook I was responsible for ensuring the kitchen was well stocked for the line cooks.
        I demonstrated proficiency in operating kitchen equipment such as meat slicers, knives, and cooking tools.
        Additionally, I learned how to adhere to strict food safety standards and maintain kitchen cleanliness.
        I was regularly praised for my efficiency in preparing their many different recipes.

        As a line cook I was responsible for preparing food to be served to the customers.
        I learned how to work on a team with the other cooks to ensure meals were served to customers in a timely matter without sacrificing quality of food.
        I also had to communicate with other cooks to organize and complete orders and minimize delays for the customer.
