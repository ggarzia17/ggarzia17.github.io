    <h4>August 2024 - Present</h4>
    <p class="project-p">
        As a software consultant I am responsible for working on a team to develop a concurrent solution to Qualcomm's data collection script.
        The current script runs by manually SSHing into each of their base stations (essentially a Linux server connected to a modem) sequentially and copying the data back to a csv file.
        This script is very slow and takes about 5-6 hours to run.
        Our project is creating a script that will run on each individual base station and make an HTTP request to send the required data back to their main server.
    </p>

    <p class="project-p">
        This project will consist of 4 main parts: writing the script, packaging it with RPM Package Manager (RPM), creating an API to receive requests from the script, and creating a database to store the data from the base stations
    </p>
