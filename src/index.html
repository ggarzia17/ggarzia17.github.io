Additionally, I am exploring the intersection of Mathematics and Computer Science by adding a minor in Computational and Applied Math.
I am currently involved with several organizations on campus. 
I am a member of the Evolve Entrepreneurship Club, where I have connected with other entrepreneurially minded students.

When I am not coding, I enjoy getting active by hiking, biking, weightlifting,   and playing basketball.
I enjoy listening to music and am teaching myself to play the guitar.
