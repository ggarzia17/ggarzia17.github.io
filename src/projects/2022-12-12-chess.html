    <h3>Chess</h3>

    <p class="project-p">
        My Chess project was built as a final project for Foundational Programming Concept and Design (CSCI200).
        The user interface built in the terminal and displays each sides captured pieces, the board, a move list, whose turn it is, and a prompt to enter the next move.
        Moves are entered by entering the square of the piece you are moving and then the square it is moving to (Algebraic notation was not added due to time constraints).
        Move validation is implemented and includes rules such as promotion, castling, 2 square first pawn moves, and check/checkmate detection.
        If an invalid move is entered it will tell the user that their move was invalid and prompt them to enter a new move.
