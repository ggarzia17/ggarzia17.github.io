    <h3>Clue</h3>
    <h4>May 2024</h4>
    <p class="project-p">
        This project was created as a group project with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bancell.dev" class="p-link">Brady Ancell</a> for Software Engineering 
        (<a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.mines.edu/search/?P=CSCI306" class="p-link">CSCI306</a>).
        The game logic was built in Java and the GUI was created using the 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html" class="p-link">Java Swing</a> framework.
        The game features all of the major rules of clue. 
        One of the more interesting to implement was moving a player when another player made a suggestion including them, and then updating their valid moves accordingly.
        For example if you end a turn in a room you are not allowed to guess there again unless you were moved there by another player.
        While implementing Clue we utilized Object Oriented Programming concepts such as polymorphism and a singleton pattern.
        In order to ensure quality of code, we implemented tests for all features using the <a target="_blank" href="https://junit.org/junit5/" class="p-link">JUnit</a> framework.

        Mines wants this source code to be private from future CSCI306 students so code is availible upon request.
