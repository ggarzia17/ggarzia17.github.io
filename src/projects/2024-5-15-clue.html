    <h3>Clue</h3>
    <h4>May 2024</h4>
    <p class="project-p">
        This project was created as a group project for Software Engineering (CSCI306).
        The game logic was built in Java and the GUI was created using the Java Swing framework.
        The game features all of the major rules of clue. 
        One of the more interesting to implement was moving a player when another player made a suggestion including them, and then updating their valid moves accordingly.
        For example if you end a turn in a room you are not allowed to guess there again unless you were moved there by another player.
        In addition to this we utilized Object Oriented Programming concepts such as polymorphism and a singleton pattern.
