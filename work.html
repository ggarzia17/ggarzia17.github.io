    <h2>Software Consultant &#x2022 CSCI370</h2>
    <h3><a class="p-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/" target="_blank">Qualcomm</a> &#x2022 Boulder CO</h3>
    <h4>August 2024 - Present</h4>
    <p class="project-p">
        As a software consultant I am responsible for working on a team to develop a concurrent solution to Qualcomm's data collection script.
        The current script runs by manually SSHing into each of their base stations (essentially a Linux server connected to a modem) sequentially and copying the data back to a csv file.
        This script is very slow and takes about 5-6 hours to run.
        Our project is creating a script that will run on each individual base station and make an HTTP request to send the required data back to their main server.
    </p>

    <p class="project-p">
        This project will consist of 4 main parts: writing the script, packaging it with RPM Package Manager (RPM), creating an API to receive requests from the script, and creating a database to store the data from the base stations

    <h2>Engineering Intern</h2>
    <h3><a target="_blank" class="p-link" href="https://whiterivertech.com/index.html">White River Technologies</a> &#x2022 Lebonan NH</h3>
    <h4>May 2024 - August 2024</h4>
    <p class="project-p">
        White River Technologies is a small research and development firm that specializes in geophysical sensors. 
        My main role was developing software to aid their electromagnetic sensor systems.
        Over the summer I completed several notable projects. 
    </p>
    <p class="project-p">
        I developed a script to configure Windows tablets for deployment with their electromagnetic sensor system.
        This included installing necessary software to monitor EM data, changing network settings so the tablet could connect to the EM sensor, and setting up OpenSSH server to ensure remote access while the device was in the field.
    </p>
    <p class="project-p">
        I designed and implemented a <a target="_blank" class="p-link" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt">PyQT</a>
        GUI to provide a user friendly way to plan drone and underwater robot survey paths and output it to several different file formats.
        The GUI included an integrated <a target="_blank" class="p-link" href="https://leafletjs.com/">leaflet.js</a> map that could either use map tiles from the internet or allow the user to provide their own for offline use 
        This GUI replaced the existing method of copying the coordinates manually into the code which was highly error prone.
    </p>
    <p class="project-p">
        I developed a GUI to modify the configuration file for their EM sensor systems and change the hardware settings.
        After changing the hardware settings the program read back the EM data stream and parsed it to ensure that the hardware settings were actually changed.
        This allowed them to not let clients have access to the configuration file which allowed them to restrict which values the clients can actually modify.
    </p>
    <p class="project-p">
        I enhanced their quality control GUI by adding functionality to manipulate different geographic file formats.
        The functionality allowed for conversion between 
        <a class="p-link" target="_blank" href="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/shapefiles/what-is-a-shapefile.htm">.shp</a> and 
        <a class="p-link" target="_blank" href="https://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/">.ply</a> files and merging of multiple .ply files.
        I also parsed the coordinate reference system data from each file format to ensure that converted files were in the same <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/mapping-utm-grid-conterminous-48-united-states" class="p-link" target="_blank">UTM zone</a>

        Service Central is a company started by my friend.
        They do many different things such as lawn care, trash removal, snow removal, painting, and several others.
        I mostly worked doing lawn care and trash removal.
        This included weedwacking, building planters, mulching, filling driveway potholes, cleaning out garages and attics, trimming bushes, and safely disposing of large items such as mattresses and drywall sheets.
